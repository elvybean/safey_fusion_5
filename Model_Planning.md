# Model Planning

- The model will not have the hinge from the Fusion 5 make it easier to use and for safety concerns
- Will need to choose a filament that is water proof and skin safe
- Possibly print model out of metal
- Model will consist of multiple components:
    - connector: connects to the razor 5 handle
    - razor_head: holds the razor blade
